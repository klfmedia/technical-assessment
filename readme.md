# KLF Technical Assessment

This is the technical assessment for candidates looking to apply for the position of PHP Developer at KLF Group. 

You can work on this technical assessment with whatever tools you'd require. For the assessments that would require you to build a function or a class, you can create the environment to test your function or class however you'd like. We'd just need to see the completed class or function.

Please allow around 2-3 hours to complete this assessment.

## Assessment 01

This is to assess your ability to evaluate syntax and to create clean, easy-to-read code.

In the file messy-code.php, it contains functional code to display, add and update basic company information with a mix of PHP and HTML forms. Using your knowledge, rewrite this file to ensure it's easy to read and has proper coding structure. You are allowed to use functions or classes to complete this task.

## Assessment 02

This assessment will serve to evaluate your troubleshooting abilities.

In the file bugg-function.php, there are a number of bugs that can cause potential issues in certain conditions. Identify these potential bugs and correct them. You are free to create or user whatever functions you'd like to complete this task.

## Assessment 03

Using the database dump in the subdirectory, create a model with base CRUD functions (to select, insert, update and delete). Assume that these functions will be called from HTML forms via GET or POST.

The purpose of this assessment will be to evaluate your code structure with basic operation. Efficiency and quality is key.

## Assessment 04

Create a class that charges taxes on an order total based on the user's province (Canada only). This class will also apply coupon discounts using a coupon code. Assume that the taxes and valid coupon codes are in a separate configuration file.

This assessment will allow us to evaluate your OOP skills.
